# Changelog

All notable changes to Hermes Town are documented here.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-17

First tagged release: the developer preview plus everything that shipped on
`main` before the tag.

### Town

- Added the Phaser pixel-art town, the countryside around it, and the scripted demo mode.
- Redrew the world from the painted reference: image atlases with a chroma key, clean sprite edges, one bridge per street, no stray walls.
- Drew residents to the concept sheet: 20×30 frames, hats by role, walk, sit, and work cycles.

### Live bridge

- Added the passive native Hermes lifecycle bridge and the authenticated loopback ingest server with read-only snapshot, SSE stream, and bounded journal.
- A fresh client now sees the present town: departed and stale sessions are omitted from the snapshot, with counts of what was left out.
- Crew choreography: every tool call sends a runner to its building and back, the session waits at the door with "waiting for you" when a turn ends, resting sessions retire to a porch, and an earlier session is remembered for the day.
- A director camera follows the most recent resident when few are active.
- Keepers for scheduled jobs: a cron run keys to its job and stands at a lamp post between runs. Skill views open a market stall per skill when `HERMES_TOWN_SKILL_NAMES=1` opts in.
- Mapped the full Hermes tool registry, plus common Claude Code tool names, to buildings.

### Verification and publishing

- Added privacy-contract, server-contract, build, browser, and plugin-loader verification.
- CI splits into a required check (build and contracts) and an advisory world walk-through with screenshots.
- The scripted demo deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- Added explicit local-only deployment guidance and MIT licensing.
